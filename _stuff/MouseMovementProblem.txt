1 System (loaded by I/O subsystem). Specifies that the driver is loaded at kernel initialization.

I also encountered this problem, fixed it by disabling "serial enumerator" in the advanced properties of the FTDI driver (properties of COM ports in Device Manager). This is described in http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/AppNotes/AN_107_AdvancedDriverOptions_AN_000073.pdf.

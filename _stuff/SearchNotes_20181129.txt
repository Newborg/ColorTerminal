Line added, nothing deleted

Line added, line deleted (5 added, 3 deleted)

from GUI send lines added and lines deleted

Used startIndex to find where to start search
OR
Look at index of last result in results list <- NOPE, will not work if result was not found in last line
OR
Index of current last line - lines added

Subtract deleted lines from start (update start based on info)
	Start should not be global? Will make more sense

Subtract deleted lines from results list indexes
OR
Keep variable showing how much to subtract from indexes (to avoid having to loop through large arrays all the time)

Find all results which have been deleted (count these) and delete from results list
(is this already done -> Sort of)
Subtract deleted results from selected result
	Only do this if selected result has not been moved(?)
